            <h1> Background </h1>

            <p> Climate change is a growing issue in today’s society. Whether people believe it or not, Climate change is real and it’s slowly killing the earth. But we at Gamba are trying to change that , Gamba focus on creating cars that use electricity, rather than running on gasoline. Gasoline cause too much air pollution and gives off a foul smelling odor when its comes out the exhaust pipe. Buy making cars that run on electricity, we can help stop the air pollution and help clean up the environment. In the future, electric transportation more than likely will be the new wave of life, and we can speed up that process. </p>

            <h1> What Inspired Us? </h1>

            <p> We were inspired by the amount of air pollution and toxic fumes that come out out of cars and other forms of land travel. The exhaustion that comes out of the exhaust pipe can give off and foul odor and can cause air pollution. We hope to change that by creating vehicles the run electricity to reduce the amount of pollution and make better travel for all citizens.</p>
